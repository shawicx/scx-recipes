# Smart Diet Assistant

A Tauri-based application for offline health diet recommendations.

## Features

- Personal health profile setup
- Personalized diet recommendations based on user profile
- Diet history tracking with ratings and notes
- Cross-platform desktop application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Completely offline operation for privacy

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Rust with Tauri
- **Database**: SQLite for local data storage
- **Architecture**: Tauri commands bridge between frontend and Rust backend

## Setup

1. Install Rust and Node.js
2. Run `npm install` to install Node.js dependencies
3. Run `cargo tauri build` to build the application

```

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture with:

- **React UI Layer**: Provides the user interface and user interactions
- **Tauri Command Bridge**: Secure API between frontend and backend
- **Rust Business Logic**: Handles all core functionality, algorithms, and data operations
- **SQLite Database**: Local data storage for user profiles, recommendations, and history

## Offline-First Design

All data is stored locally with no network dependencies. The recommendation algorithm processes data locally on the user's device.
