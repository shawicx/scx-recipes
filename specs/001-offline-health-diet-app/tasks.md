# Tasks: Offline Health Diet Recommendation App

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-offline-health-diet-app/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Tauri App**: `src/` (frontend), `src-tauri/` (backend/Rust), `tests/` at repository root
- Paths follow the project structure from plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create Tauri project structure with React frontend and Rust backend
- [x] T002 Initialize package.json with React dependencies (react, react-dom, typescript, etc.)
- [x] T003 [P] Initialize Cargo.toml with Tauri dependencies (tauri, rusqlite, serde, chrono)
- [x] T004 [P] Configure TypeScript settings (tsconfig.json) for React frontend
- [x] T005 Setup project directory structure (components/, lib/, styles/, assets/)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 Setup SQLite database schema and migrations framework in src-tauri/
- [x] T007 [P] Configure Tauri to work with SQLite database in src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
- [x] T008 Create base data models (HealthProfile, DietRecommendation, DietHistory, Recipe) in src-tauri/src/storage/models.rs
- [x] T009 Setup database connection and operations in src-tauri/src/storage/database.rs
- [x] T010 [P] Implement configuration management for local data storage paths in src-tauri/src/config/
- [x] T011 Create TypeScript type definitions in src/lib/types.ts that match Rust structs
- [x] T012 Setup Tauri command API wrapper in src/lib/api.ts
- [x] T013 Configure cross-platform local data storage (macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/, Windows: %APPDATA%/, Linux: ~/.local/share/)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Setup Personal Health Profile (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable user to enter and save their personal health profile information in the local database

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering health information and verifying that the data is correctly stored locally. Delivers the ability to save and retrieve user health profile information.

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - View Personalized Diet Recommendations (Priority: P1) üéØ Core Value

**Goal**: Generate and display personalized diet recommendations based on user's health profile using local algorithm

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting up a user profile and verifying that personalized recommendations are generated. Delivers the core value of providing tailored diet suggestions.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Manage and Track Diet History (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Allow users to track which meals they've tried, rate them, and maintain a dietary history

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by trying meals and tracking them in the history. Delivers the ability to maintain a personal food diary and reflect on past choices.

### Implementation for User Story 3

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on HealthProfile from US1 for recommendation generation
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 and US2 for tracking history of recommendations

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
