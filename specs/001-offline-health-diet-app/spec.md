# Feature Specification: Offline Health Diet Recommendation App

**Feature Branch**: `001-offline-health-diet-app`  
**Created**: Sunday, October 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "构建一个可离线运行的智能健康饮食推荐应用。用户无需登录，数据保存在本地，通过 Rust 后端算法生成个性化食谱推荐，并以 Tauri 提供跨平台桌面界面。"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Setup Personal Health Profile (Priority: P1)

User opens the application for the first time and sets up their health profile including age, weight, height, dietary preferences, allergies, and health goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, maintaining health). The data is stored locally on the device and used to generate diet recommendations.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational step that enables all other functionality. Without a health profile, the app cannot generate personalized recommendations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering health information and verifying that the data is correctly stored locally. Delivers the ability to save and retrieve user health profile information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user opens the app for the first time, **When** user enters health profile information, **Then** information is saved locally and persists between app sessions
2. **Given** user has already set up their profile, **When** user revisits the profile page, **Then** previously entered health information is displayed

### User Story 2 - View Personalized Diet Recommendations (Priority: P1)

Based on the user's health profile, the system generates personalized diet recommendations using a local algorithm. Users can browse, save, and mark recommendations as tried. All data processing happens locally without requiring internet connection.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the app - providing personalized recommendations without any internet dependency.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting up a user profile and verifying that personalized recommendations are generated. Delivers the core value of providing tailored diet suggestions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has set up their health profile, **When** user views diet recommendations, **Then** algorithm produces personalized meal suggestions based on profile data
2. **Given** user is viewing recommendations, **When** user marks a recommendation as tried, **Then** the recommendation is appropriately flagged in the local database
3. **Given** user has dietary restrictions, **When** recommendations are generated, **Then** none of the suggestions contain restricted foods

### User Story 3 - Manage and Track Diet History (Priority: P2)

Users can track which meals they've tried, rate them, and maintain a dietary history. The system allows users to look back at their food choices and potentially identify patterns related to their health goals.

**Why this priority**: Enhances the core functionality by allowing users to track their progress and build a history of their food choices.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by trying meals and tracking them in the history. Delivers the ability to maintain a personal food diary and reflect on past choices.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has tried a recommended meal, **When** user accesses history, **Then** the meal appears in the dietary history
2. **Given** user wants to track a meal not from recommendations, **When** user logs an external meal, **Then** it is saved in the local history

### Edge Cases

- What happens when local storage exceeds reasonable limits?
- How does the system handle inconsistent or contradictory health profile information?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **FR-013**: System MUST NOT require user authentication or login of any kind
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide an intuitive user interface that doesn't require technical knowledge to operate

### Key Entities

- **HealthProfile**: User's personal health information including age, weight, height, gender, dietary preferences, allergies, and health goals
- **DietRecommendation**: A personalized meal suggestion generated based on user's health profile, containing meal details, nutritional information, and recipe
- **DietHistory**: Record of meals the user has tried, including date, rating, and notes
- **DietaryRestriction**: List of foods or ingredients the user cannot consume due to allergies, preferences, or medical reasons

## Assumptions

- The application will have a built-in database of common foods and recipes to draw from for recommendations
- Users will have basic computer literacy to navigate the desktop application
- Health profile data will follow standard medical conventions for measurements (metric/imperial units as appropriate)
- The system will use well-established nutritional guidelines and dietary science as the basis for recommendations
- Performance requirements are within standard desktop application expectations
- Transparency of recommendation algorithms means providing understandable explanations rather than revealing proprietary methodologies
