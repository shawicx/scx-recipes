# Research Findings: Offline Health Diet Recommendation App

**Date**: Sunday, October 19, 2025  
**Feature**: Offline Health Diet Recommendation App  
**Branch**: 001-offline-health-diet-app

## Executive Summary

Research completed for building an offline-first health diet recommendation application using Tauri with Rust backend and React frontend. The architecture ensures all data remains local while providing personalized recommendations through sophisticated algorithms.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend: Tauri + React + TypeScript

**Decision**: Use Tauri framework with React frontend to create cross-platform desktop application.

**Rationale**: 
- Tauri provides excellent security by running frontend in a sandboxed environment
- All system access goes through explicit, permission-based APIs
- Enables sharing a single React codebase across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Rust-based backend ensures performance and safety
- Perfect for offline application requiring local data storage

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Electron: More established but larger bundle size and security concerns
- Native desktop frameworks: Would require separate codebases for each platform
- Web app with PWA: Would not meet complete offline requirement as effectively

### Backend: Rust with Tauri Commands

**Decision**: Implement core logic in Rust using Tauri's command system for API bridge.

**Rationale**:
- Rust provides memory safety without garbage collection, ideal for performance
- Tauri commands provide secure, typed API between frontend and backend
- Perfect isolation between UI layer and business logic
- Excellent for processing-intensive recommendation algorithms
- Strong ecosystem for scientific computation

### Data Storage: SQLite + JSON

**Decision**: Use SQLite for structured data (profiles, history, recipes) and JSON for configuration/cache.

**Rationale**:
- SQLite is embedded, requires no separate server process
- Handles concurrent access well with proper transaction management
- Supports complex queries for recommendation filtering
- JSON is simple for configuration and cached data
- Both technologies work well offline without network dependencies

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pure file-based storage: Would lack query capabilities needed for recommendations
- PostgreSQL: Would require network and server process, violating offline requirement
- Key-value store: Would limit complex query requirements for recommendations

### Recommendation Algorithm: Rule-Based Engine with ML Option

**Decision**: Start with rule-based recommendation engine with potential for ONNX ML model integration.

**Rationale**:
- Rule-based system is transparent and explainable to users
- Can incorporate dietary restrictions, nutritional requirements, and preferences
- Provides immediate functionality without ML complexity
- ONNX runtime allows future ML enhancement when needed
- All processing happens locally as required

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Simple keyword matching: Would be too basic for nutrition recommendations
- Complex neural networks: Would be too resource-intensive for local processing
- Pre-computed recommendations: Would not be personalized enough

## Best Practices & Patterns

### Tauri Command Pattern

**Best Practice**: Define all backend functionality as Tauri commands with proper error handling.

```rust
#[tauri::command]
async fn get_recommendations(
    profile: HealthProfile, 
    db: tauri::State<'_, DatabaseConnection>
) -> Result<Vec<DietRecommendation>, String> {
    // Command implementation with error handling
}
```

**Rationale**: This pattern ensures:
- Type-safe communication between frontend and backend
- Proper error handling and serialization
- Security through explicit function exposure
- Asynchronous execution to prevent UI blocking

### Data Layer Design

**Best Practice**: Implement repository pattern for data access with proper transaction management.

**Rationale**: This ensures:
- Separation of concerns between business logic and data storage
- Consistent error handling across different storage operations
- Easy testing with mock implementations
- Proper transaction management for data consistency

### Performance Considerations

**Best Practice**: Implement caching for expensive operations and async operations for UI responsiveness.

**Rationale**: 
- Offline applications must be responsive without the option to "wait for server"
- Recommendation algorithms might be computationally intensive
- Caching frequent operations reduces computation time
- Async operations prevent UI freezing

### Privacy & Security

**Best Practice**: Implement zero-knowledge architecture with no external data transmission.

**Rationale**:
- Core principle of the application
- Data never leaves the user's device
- Local encryption if needed for sensitive health information
- Clear data deletion functionality

## Research Tasks Completed

1. **Tauri Framework Evaluation**: Confirmed suitability for cross-platform desktop apps with Rust backend
2. **Rust Ecosystem Analysis**: Identified necessary crates (rusqlite, serde, chrono, onnxruntime)
3. **Offline Architecture Patterns**: Researched architecture patterns for fully offline applications
4. **Recommendation Algorithm Options**: Evaluated different recommendation approaches for local processing
5. **Cross-Platform UI Frameworks**: Compared React vs other frameworks in Tauri context
6. **Local Storage Solutions**: Analyzed SQLite vs other embedded storage options
7. **Performance Requirements**: Validated that Rust backend can meet sub-200ms response times

## Next Steps & Assumptions

### Assumptions Validated

1. Rust can implement nutrition-based recommendation algorithms with acceptable performance
2. Tauri provides sufficient security model for health data
3. SQLite can handle the data volume requirements (under 100MB as per success criteria)
4. ONNX runtime is available for Rust and suitable for optional ML enhancements

### Risks Identified

1. **Bundle Size**: Tauri + Rust + dependencies might approach the 150MB limit
2. **ML Model Size**: ONNX models might require significant space if included
3. **Platform Compatibility**: Different platforms might have different behaviors for file paths
4. **Testing Complexity**: Testing across 3 platforms adds complexity

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Bundle Optimization**: Use release builds with size optimizations, strip symbols
2. **Modular ML**: Make ML model optional and downloadable if needed
3. **Cross-Platform Paths**: Use proper Rust path abstractions that work across platforms
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement testing across all target platforms in CI
